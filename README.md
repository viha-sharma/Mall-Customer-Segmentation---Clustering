### ✪Problem Statement

Customer segmentation is the process of separating customers into groups based on certain traits or spending behaviors.
Why is clustering needed? 

It creates a WIN-WIN situation for customers and stores.
Stores can identify the right customers for particular products, offers, and services– which is beneficial for customers. This translates into higher revenue and customer demand for stores.

### ✪My Approach

Creating Customer clusters to identify the different types of customers 

This is achieved through unsupervised clustering algorithms in Machine Learning

As this is a clustering problem, I will be utilising supervised machine learning algorithms such as KMeans Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering and DBSCAN Clustering. Additionally, I will automate the clustering process by creating a mini clustering program using python.
